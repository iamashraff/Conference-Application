### Notes

By default, when the mobile application is running on the first time it will check either if the database tables named `conference_info`, `specialize_area` and `login` already exists. If some or non of the database table is exists, it will automatically create the database tables in SQLite.

These tables will be created with the following command;

> CREATE TABLE users (<br>
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,<br>
username TEXT NOT NULL,<br>
password TEXT NOT NULL<br>
)<br>

> CREATE TABLE specialize_area (<br>
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,<br>
area TEXT NOT NULL,<br>
description TEXT NULL,<br>
imageUrl TEXT NULL<br>
)<br>

>CREATE TABLE conference_info (<br>
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,<br>
name TEXT NOT NULL,<br>
email TEXT NOT NULL,<br>
phone INTEGER NOT NULL,<br>
role TEXT NOT NULL,<br>
specialize INTEGER NOT NULL,<br>
user INTEGER NOT NULL,<br>
FOREIGN KEY(specialize) REFERENCES specialize_area(id),<br>
FOREIGN KEY(user) REFERENCES users(id)<br>
)<br>

Also, a default user account will be created with the following login credentials;
> ID : 1<br> 
Username : test<br> 
Password : test<br>
